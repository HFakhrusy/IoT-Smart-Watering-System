Smart Plant Watering System

The system operates by detecting soil moisture levels and environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity using sensors installed on the plants. Based on the collected data, the ESP32 controls the irrigation process automatically when the soil is dry and the surrounding temperature and humidity are not optimal for plant growth. Additionally, through integration with the Blynk IoT platform, users can monitor plant conditions and control irrigation remotely via a mobile app or other internet-connected devices. This enables users to efficiently and responsively care for their plants, even when they are not physically near them.
